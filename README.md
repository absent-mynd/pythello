# pythello
A python implementation of the board game Othello, with a rudimentary GUI and a variety of computer agents

## Run the program:
Requires the following libraries:
- graphics.py  :  `pip install graphics.py`  

To run the program, run the following command:
```
python ./pythello_gui.py
```

## Set Agents
To set the agents, currently you must edit lines 248 to 266 in `pythello_gui.py` by uncommenting the desired agent.  Agents switch colors every playthrough.  The user can play by uncommenting the HumanAgent line, and two players can play by uncommenting the HumanAgent line for both agents.  Similarly for the other agents.  Comment out undesired agents.
