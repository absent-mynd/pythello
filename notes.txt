Working notes for development

key :   o - not completed
        x - completed
        / - not a priority/abandoned

/ switch color numbers to be [-1, 1] instead of [1, 2] to follow common practice

GUI:  o - add display options, to show whose turn, current stone counts, turn count, etc.
      o - Add "Winner" gui
      o - add "undo turn" input
      o - how to specify which agents are playing? command line input?
        
o - headless mode which simulates the entire game are returns the winner without drawing

o - framework for simulating two agents against each other repeatedly, tallying wins

/ - Faster "potential move" generation, rather than checking every square for adjacency?

x - greedy agent - always makes the move that flips the most tokens
x - generous agent - always makes the move that flips the least tokens

x - greedy agent + heuristics - always makes the move that gets the most points, considering position value
x - generous agent + heuristics - converse of above

/ - diagonal agent, orthogonal agent - always makes the move that flips the most tokens diagonally or orthogonally, respectively

x - alpha-beta
x - pure monte carlo
x - monte-carlo
o - NN

x - edge cases - corner changes colors? - from testing and observations the game is sound for 8x8 and 6x6.
